This project is from my Programming Abstractions class at UC Santa Cruz

Project Description: Created a program that displays 3D fireworks using Pygame and PyOpenGL.
Pygame was used for creating the display and incorporating user interaction, while PyOpenGL was used
for rendering and drawing effects.

There is an added .wav file for sound effects.
